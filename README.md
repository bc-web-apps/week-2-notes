# Week 2: HTML + CSS

As we learned in the last week, the internet is all built on simple text! Even this website that you are reading right now is designed and rendered from simple lines of text. The language of this text is called `HTML` and it stands for **Hypertext Markup Language**. You can start to think of your web browser as a viewer that can "view" these files. Similar to how you use Microsoft Word to open and view Word documents, you use your web browser to view HTML files. We will discuss later on how CSS fits into this picture as well.

## The Basics of HTML

### Tags
Everything in HTML is built upon HTML tags. These tags are denoted with the carrot `<` `>` symbols. You can think of HTML as being compromised of sentences that represent different page elements that you see. For example, at the top of this page there is a search bar, this is simply an input feild that lets users type into.

Each tag comes in a pair, and has a starting and ending tag. They are usually denoted such that `<tagName>` begins like this, and ends with a backwards slash such as `</tagName>`. 

**Note:** you must always have an opening and closing tag, otherwise your page will not load properly.
